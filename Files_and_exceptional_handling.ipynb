        " Memory Managewment in Python is necessary for following reasons:-\n",
        "**1. Efficient Resource Usage**\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory management ensures that the program uses the system’s memory efficiently. Proper management avoids memory leaks (where memory that is no longer needed isn't released) and helps keep the program's memory footprint as low as possible, which is essential for optimal performance, especially in memory-constrained environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Performance Optimization**\n",
        "\n",
        "Efficient memory use can lead to faster program execution. When memory is well-managed, the Python interpreter can handle larger data structures and more complex operations without slowing down. Proper memory management also helps in avoiding excessive paging and swapping that could occur if the system runs out of RAM.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Automatic Garbage Collection**\n",
        "\n",
        "Python has built-in garbage collection, which helps manage memory by automatically reclaiming unused memory. The Python Garbage Collector (GC) uses a technique called reference counting combined with a cyclic garbage collector to manage the lifecycle of objects. This means Python can automatically detect and clean up objects that are no longer in use, thus preventing memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Avoiding Memory Leaks**\n",
        "\n",
        "A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but does not release it when it is no longer needed, leading to gradual memory consumption and potentially slowing down the system or causing it to crash. Python's garbage collector helps mitigate this risk by tracking object references and freeing memory when there are no more references to an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Improved Scalability**\n",
        "\n",
        "For large-scale applications, managing memory well can be the difference between a program that runs efficiently and one that becomes sluggish as it scales. Memory management allows Python programs to handle more data and more simultaneous operations, supporting growth and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Managing Complex Data Structures**\n",
        "\n",
        "Python applications often deal with complex data structures like lists, dictionaries, and custom objects. Proper memory management helps in allocating and deallocating memory as these structures grow or shrink, which keeps the application responsive and minimizes potential slowdowns.\n",

        "**1. Memory Leaks:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Cyclic References: When objects reference each other, the garbage collector might not be able to identify them as unused, leading to memory leaks.\n",
        "* Global Variables: Global variables can persist throughout the program's execution, preventing their memory from being reclaimed.\n",
        "* Third-Party Libraries: Some libraries might have memory leaks or inefficient memory usage practices.\n",
