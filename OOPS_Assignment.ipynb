        "##**Question-1) What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer-1)** Five key concepts of OOP are:-\n",
        "1. **Inheritance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (child or subclass) can acquire the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (parent or superclass). It allows for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes. For example, a Dog class might inherit from an Animal class, gaining its attributes and methods while also adding its own specific features.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Abstraction:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by hiding the unnecessary details and exposing only the essential features. It allows a programmer to focus on a simplified interface for interacting with objects, without worrying about the underlying implementation. For example, in a car object, we might only need to know how to drive the car, without needing to understand how the engine works internally.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Polymorphism:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single method or function to work with different types of objects. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding (where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method defined in the superclass) and method overloading (where the same method name can be used with different parameters). This promotes flexibility and the ability to extend systems without changing existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Encapsulation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which is usually done by making some attributes or methods private and only providing access through public methods (getters and setters). This helps protect the integrity of the data and prevents unintended interference from outside the\n",
        "class.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Objects and Classes:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Class:\n",
        "\n",
        " A class in OOP is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a data structure that encapsulates both the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) that operate on the data. A class serves as the foundation for creating instances (objects) that share the same structure but can have unique data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Object:\n",
        "\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is created. Each object created from the same class can have different values for its attributes, but all objects share the same structure and behaviors (methods) as defined by the class.\n",
